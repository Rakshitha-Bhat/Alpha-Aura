Oil Spill Detection Using AI 🌊🚨
Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered solution for real-time oil spill detection in marine environments. Using cutting-edge machine learning techniques, the system processes satellite imagery to identify and alert relevant authorities about potential oil spills, ensuring quick responses to environmental disasters. 🌍

The project leverages Deep Learning models to accurately identify oil spills from satellite images, and the GUI interface allows for smooth and easy interaction with the system. The project is designed to operate without the need for external IoT devices, relying solely on AI for processing and detection.

Why Use This?
🌿 Environmental Protection: Quickly detect oil spills, reducing harm to marine ecosystems.
⚡ Efficient & Real-Time Detection: Automated, fast detection of oil spills with high accuracy.
💻 User-Friendly Interface: Seamlessly visualize and interact with oil spill detection data.
🚀 State-of-the-Art AI Models: Utilizes the latest in AI and Deep Learning for the most accurate detection.
Technologies Used
🐍 Python for the backend logic and AI processing.
🧠 TensorFlow/Keras for training deep learning models to detect oil spills.
📷 OpenCV and Pillow for image processing and handling.
💻 Flask/Django for developing the GUI (user interface).
🖼️ Satellite Imagery Datasets for training the models.
🛠️ GitHub for version control and collaboration.
Features
Real-time Oil Spill Detection: Uses AI models to analyze satellite images and detect oil spills.
Intuitive GUI Interface: A clean, easy-to-use interface for displaying detected oil spills.
Image Preprocessing: Preprocessing of satellite images for accurate model input.
Customizable Alerts: Alerts for detected oil spills sent via email/notification.
No IoT Dependency: Relies on AI and satellite imagery, no external devices required.
Installation Guide
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/oil-spill-detection.git
cd oil-spill-detection
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Ensure Python 3.7 or later is installed. Then, run the following:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Set Up Your Environment
Ensure you have access to satellite image datasets for training the model. If necessary, preprocess your images and store them in the /data directory.

Step 4: Run the Application
After everything is set up, run the application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
This will launch the GUI interface where you can upload satellite images and analyze them for potential oil spills.

GUI Features
Upload Satellite Image: Choose an image to analyze.
Real-Time Detection: Displays results based on AI model predictions.
Visual Feedback: Results are shown with bounding boxes around detected oil spills.
